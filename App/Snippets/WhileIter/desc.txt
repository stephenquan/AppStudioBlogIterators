The first impression is this "while" version looks a bit hard to swallow.

The "for of" shorten version looks cleaner.

When you think about it, this version actually gives you more insight into the "yield" keyword.

When "yield" is used, a value is returned from the Javascript generator, and the Javascript generator pauses execution until the next time we call "iter.next()".
